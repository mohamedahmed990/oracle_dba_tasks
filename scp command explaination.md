The command you provided is an `scp` (secure copy) command used to securely transfer a file between two systems (typically from one server or virtual machine to another). Let’s break down the command and explain each part in detail:

### Command Breakdown:
```bash
$ scp oracle_home.tar.gz user@target_vm:/u01/app/oracle/
```

1. **`$`**: 
   - The dollar sign (`$`) represents the shell prompt and is not part of the actual command. It simply indicates that the command is being executed in a shell (like bash or sh).

2. **`scp`**: 
   - **`scp`** stands for "Secure Copy". It is a command-line utility that allows you to securely copy files between hosts (local and remote or between two remote hosts) over an SSH connection.

3. **`oracle_home.tar.gz`**:
   - This is the source file you want to transfer. In this case, it refers to the compressed Oracle Home directory, `oracle_home.tar.gz`, located on the source machine (the VM you're currently logged into).
   
4. **`user@target_vm:`**:
   - This part specifies the target VM and the user that will be used to log into the target VM.
     - **`user`**: Replace this with the actual username that exists on the target VM and has sufficient permissions to write into the destination directory (e.g., `oracle`, `root`, or any other relevant user).
     - **`target_vm`**: Replace this with the hostname, IP address, or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the target VM. For example, if the target VM’s IP is `192.168.1.100`, this part would be `user@192.168.1.100:`.
   
5. **`/u01/app/oracle/`**:
   - This is the destination directory on the target VM where you want the file to be copied. 
   - In this example, it's `/u01/app/oracle/`, which is typically the directory where Oracle installations are stored.
   - Ensure that this directory exists on the target VM and that the user specified in `user@target_vm` has the proper permissions to write to it.

### What Happens When You Issue This Command:
1. **Secure SSH Connection**:
   - The `scp` command will use SSH (Secure Shell) to connect from the current machine (source VM) to the `target_vm` using the credentials provided (`user@target_vm`).

2. **Password Prompt**:
   - If it’s your first time connecting to the target VM, or if you don't have key-based authentication set up, you’ll be prompted to enter the password for the `user` on the `target_vm`. If key-based authentication is set up, it will use the private key to authenticate and proceed without prompting for a password.

3. **File Transfer**:
   - Once authenticated, `scp` will securely transfer the file `oracle_home.tar.gz` from the current VM to the `/u01/app/oracle/` directory on the target VM.

4. **Completion**:
   - After the transfer completes, the file `oracle_home.tar.gz` will be available in the `/u01/app/oracle/` directory on the target VM. You can check the directory on the target VM by running:
     ```bash
     ls /u01/app/oracle/
     ```
     to verify that the file has been transferred successfully.

### What You Should Modify for Your Case:

- **`oracle_home.tar.gz`**: 
  Ensure that the file name corresponds to the actual file you created on your source VM (for example, you might have a different path or name for the tarball).

- **`user`**: 
  Replace `user` with the actual username that exists on the target VM. This could be `oracle` or any other user with sufficient privileges to copy files to `/u01/app/oracle/`. If you are not sure which user to use, it’s likely the same user that owns Oracle files on your system (often `oracle`).

- **`target_vm`**: 
  Replace `target_vm` with the IP address, hostname, or domain name of the target VM where you want to transfer the Oracle Home tarball. You can find the IP address of the target VM using the `hostname -I` or `ip addr show` command from the target VM’s terminal.

- **Destination Directory (`/u01/app/oracle/`)**: 
  Make sure the destination directory exists on the target VM. If not, you might need to create it or choose a different path. To create the directory on the target VM (if it doesn't exist), run:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/
  ```

### Example Customization for Your Case:

Let’s assume the following:
- The tarball file on the source VM is named `oracle19c_home.tar.gz`.
- The target VM’s IP address is `192.168.1.50`.
- The user on the target VM is `oracle`.

The modified command would look like this:
```bash
scp oracle19c_home.tar.gz oracle@192.168.1.50:/u01/app/oracle/
```

You would execute this command from your source VM terminal, and it would prompt you for the password of the `oracle` user on the target VM.

Does this make sense for your situation, or do you need additional clarification on a specific part?
